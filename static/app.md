<p><strong>WebTorrent App lets you stream torrents.</strong> Whether it's video from the Internet Archive, music from Creative Commons, or audiobooks from Librivox, you don't have to wait for it to finish downloading.</p>

<p><strong>WebTorrent App connects to both BitTorrent and WebTorrent peers.</strong> It can talk to peers running Transmission or uTorrent, and it can also talk to web pages like instant.io.</p>

<p><strong>WebTorrent is in beta.</strong> We think it's pretty sweet, but we're still working on it. Try it out and let us know what you think!</p>
